# Builder Design Pattern :construction_worker:

Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. The process of constructing an object should be generic so that it can be used to create different representations of the same object.

Builder Pattern is used mostly when large number of difference types of objects are to be made but these objects use same object building processes (i.e., objects have same methods but those methods do a bit different stuff)

## Explaining with Example :wink:

In this example there is a CIVILEngineer class that creates many different types of houses (objects) based on the object of the house blueprint classes. This example contains:

1. **House class:** This class has methods for creating different parts of the house: setRoof(), setFloor(), setInterior(), setWalls(), etc
2. **house blueprint classes:** Many other classes like **IglooBlueprint class**, **TentHouseBlueprint class**, **BambooHutBlueprint class**, etc creates an object of the **House class** and calls its methods with specific parameters to modify the object creation. Eg: **IglooBlueprint class** has a method `buildWalls()` which calls `house.setWalls('Ice blocks')`.
3. **CIVILEngineer class:** This class takes an object of one of the **house blueprint classes** and returns an object of **House class**

## Terms Used in Builder Patterns :scroll:

- **Builder:** This abstract base class defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product. Each step is generally abstract as the actual functionality of the builder is carried out in the concrete subclasses. The *GetProduct method* is used to return the final product. The builder class is often replaced with a simple interface. In the example above **House class** is a Builder class.
- **ConcreteBuilder:** There may be any number of concrete builder classes inheriting from Builder. These classes contain the functionality to create a particular complex product. In the example above **IglooBlueprint class**, **TentHouseBlueprint class** and **BambooHutBlueprint class** are ConcreteBuilder classes.
- **Director:** The director class controls the algorithm that generates the final product object. The director calls methods of the concrete builder in the correct order to generate the product object. On completion of the process, the *GetProduct method* of the builder object can be used to return the product. In the example above **CIVILEngineer class** is a Director class.
- **Product:** The product class defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern. In the above example the user defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated therefor he / she acts like the **Product**
